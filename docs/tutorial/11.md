# 11. Connecting the components

## Section goals
- Connect the app to an Ethereum provider
- Understand a dapp workflow
- Interact with the contract (through the app)

## Content structure
- The idea is to go through every aspect of boilerplate's Dapp.js in "working" order. Maybe divide the content in two sections (tbd)
