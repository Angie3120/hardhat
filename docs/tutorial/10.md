# 10. Writing the components

## Section goals
- Understand the app (what are we building?)
- Write the components and logic

## Content structure
- Memory refresh of Token contract
- App description
  - Get account balance
  - Transfer tokens
- Components (without the Ethereum part but with some logic)
  - A single component `Dapp.js` will be in charge of the logic of the application
    - This will be the only one that knows anything about Ethereum
    - Also the only one with its own state
    - It will reflect parts of the contrat's state
  - The rest of the components are presentational components without any logic
    - We are not going to show them here, you can read their code in the boilerplate, but it's just HTML
