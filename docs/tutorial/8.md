# 8. Setting up the front-end

- Let's start coding our dapp with React

## Setting up a React App

- React has proven to be a relatively easy learning curve for many developers and also one of the most popular libraries for frontend development. 
- We choose Facebook's [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) for this tutorial to avoid any kind of build configuration problem and get to the basics of building a dapp as soon as possible.
- Open a terminal on your project root directory and run `npx create-react-app frontend`. This command will create a new React app inside a folder named `frontend` (you should see this folder alongside `contracts` and `test`).
- After installation ends, run `cd frontend and npm install --save bootstrap`. This will install Bootstrap for some basic styling with. 

## Starting your React App

::: tip
If you're already familiar with React Apps, skip to the next section.
:::

- Create React App will generate 3 different folders:
  - `public/` for static assets
  - `src/` the code of the app
  - `src/components` contains the react components

- It'll also generate `index.js` which will be responsible of initializing the app
- Take a moment or so to inspect the files
- To initialize the project run `npm start`. If everything went well, your app should be available on `http://localhost:3000`.
- It'll also automatically reload when your code changes
