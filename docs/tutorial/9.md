::: danger Section goals
- Integrate (deploy) the contract to the app
- Get some faucet eth/tokens
:::

::: danger Content structure
- `deploy-frontend.js`
  - Deploy to `localhost`
  - Copying the artifacts and saving the address
    - `src/contracts` has the ABI and address of the contract and these are automatically generated by the deployment script
- Faucet 
  - Create a custom **Buidler** task we included that uses the balance of the deploying account to send 100 MBT and 1 ETH to your address. This will allow you to send tokens to another address.
  - `npx buidler --network localhost faucet`
  - In the terminal where you ran `npx buidler node` you should also see: [output]
